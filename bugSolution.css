The solution to this specificity issue involves understanding and adjusting the CSS selector to ensure that the intended styles are applied.
There are two main ways to fix this issue.

1. **Adjust existing selectors:** Remove the redundant `div` selector from `#unique.special div` and make the style for `#unique.special` more explicit:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.special {
  color: red;
}

#unique {
  color: green;
}

#unique.special {
  color: purple;
}
```

2. **Use `!important` (Not Recommended):** The `!important` flag can force a style declaration to override other declarations regardless of specificity. However, this is generally discouraged as it makes the code harder to maintain and can lead to conflicts.

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.special {
  color: red;
}

#unique {
  color: green;
}

#unique.special {
  color: purple !important;
}
```

The first solution is preferred for maintaining clean and predictable CSS. The second is provided for awareness but is considered bad practice.
